      <strong> 
        Food 1: 
      </strong>
      <br> 
        Pho 
      </br>
        A national dish at Vietnam, a chicken based broth with noodles, beef, beef balls, etc. 
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>
        Food 2: 
      </strong>
      <br> 
        Dumplings
      </br>
        A bite-sized croissant shaped of dough wrapped around a filling (usually pork) and is cooked to a crisp. 
        They can be sweet or savory — and I love it with a tangy sauce. 
    </p>

      <strong>
        Food 3: 
      </strong>
      <br>
      Steak
      </br>
      A chunk of meat taken from a cow, depending on the cut of meat will be based on preference. 
      Common cuts of steaks are — Ribeyes, Filet mignon, Sirloin, T-bone, etc. 
      I love my steaks medium rare and more on the rare side, so if they're rare its fine! 
    </p>

      <strong>
        Food 4: 
      </strong>
      <br>
      Fried Chicken 
      </br>
      A part of the chicken with a marinade and batter that gets tossed into huge amounts of oil. 
      The perfection of the crispy bite is immaculate. Any types of fried chicken is amazing, I personally love 
      Churches chicken and also just korean fried chicken.

      <strong>
        Food 5: 
      </strong> 
      <br>
      Sushi and Sashimi
      </br>
      A typical roll of fish with rice and seaweed. My favourite Sushi is california roll and spicy salmon rolls.
      I also love eating salmon sashimi, the flavour of everything together and the soy sauce is just amazing!
